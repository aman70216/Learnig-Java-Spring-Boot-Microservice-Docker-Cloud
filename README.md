# Java Spring Boot Microservices Project 🚀

This repository contains my learning journey with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Microservices**, **Docker**, and **Cloud** technologies.  
It includes sample projects, experiments, and practice code as I explore modern backend development.

### 🔑 Tips
- Keep your README simple but informative.  
- Add **badges** (like build status, Docker pulls, etc.) later when you’re comfortable.  
- Update it regularly as you learn new concepts (e.g., add Kubernetes once you start).

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to add **diagrams** (like architecture flow of microservices) inside your README using Markdown? That makes it look professional and helps explain your project visually.
